# calculator

The purpose of this project is to create an onscreen calculator using html, css, and javascript.

Through this project I applied the html, css, and javacsript I had optained from the course up to this point. I designed the calculator 
html to create the containers so that everything would be organized and easy to access. 

I used CSS to design it in a simple and familiar way. 

For the javascript, I used what I had learned up to this point regarding dom manipulation and simple scripting to combine them into
a larger and more complex program that could function in a way people have come to expect a calculator to function.
